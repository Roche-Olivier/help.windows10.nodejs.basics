> As an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime, Node.js is designed to build scalable network applications. 


> Thread-based networking is relatively inefficient and very difficult to use. Furthermore, users of Node.js are free from worries of dead-locking the process, since there are no locks.<br/> Almost no function in Node.js directly performs I/O, so the process never blocks. <br/>Because nothing blocks, scalable systems are very reasonable to develop in Node.js.

> In Node.js, there is no such start-the-event-loop call. Node.js simply enters the event loop after executing the input script.<br/> Node.js exits the event loop when there are no more callbacks to perform.<br/> This behavior is like browser JavaScript â€” the event loop is hidden from the user.



> HTTP is a first-class citizen in Node.js, designed with streaming and low latency in mind. <br/>This makes Node.js well suited for the foundation of a web library or framework.
